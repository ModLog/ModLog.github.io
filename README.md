# What is ModLog?

The short answer is that it is a simple and easy tool that shows us when posts and comments have been removed by moderators on Reddit. To help power it, you click this link, then click "allow".

The shorter answer is that it is decentralized user-powered anti-censorship "bot".

How about a little more?

/r/undelete, /r/POLITIC, /r/ModerationLog, etc., subreddits dedicated to monitoring post removals on reddit through the use of bots have shown us some of the blatant censorship that some moderators exercise. Unfortunately the bots can't catch everything on their own due to rate limits in the API. Now /u/go1dfish has decentralized the bot so that anyone can take part in being those who watch the watchers.

Clicking on the button on this page: https://modlog.github.io/#/monitor and then clicking "allow" will give the bot permission to use your account for one hour to identify and post to /r/modlog any comments or posts that have been removed by moderators all across Reddit, so long as you keep the browser tab open, sharing the workload with others who love transparency and honesty.

Note: This will cause your Reddit account to post a lot of items in a short period of time, so if you don't want that filling up your posting history, then you can use an alternate account that has enough karma to bypass captchas.

## Wait, what about my public moderation log setup? I already make my subreddit's mod actions visible.

That's great! Whether you're using /r/uncensorship or /u/publicmodlogs or some other method, we salute you for your dedication to transparency and your sound judgment in reinforcing the trust your community has in you as a moderator. /r/modlogs does not really relate to your specific subreddit or your specific account, it's more a decentralized monitoring of all subreddits - including those which do not make their official moderation log public.

Think of it as a tool we can collectively wield to keep moderator misconduct visible - and to prove the good moderators aren't removing things that shouldn't be removed.
